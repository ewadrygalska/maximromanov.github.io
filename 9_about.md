**Maxim Romanov** is a postdoctoral associate at the Department of Classics and [the Perseus Digital Library Project][1], Tufts University. His dissertation (Near Eastern Studies, U of Michigan, 2013) explored how modern computational techniques of text analysis can be applied to the study of premodern Arabic historical sources. In particular, he studied “The History of Islam” (*Taʾrīḫ al-islām*), the largest of surviving biographical collections with over 30,000 biographies, written by the Damascene scholar al-Ḏahabī (d. 1348 CE). He is continuing his research and develops methods of computational analysis for other genres of premodern Arabic literature, mainly large volume collections—bibliographical collections, collections of traditions (*ḥadīṯ*), collections of legal decisions (<i>fatwá</i>s), interpretation of the Qurʾān (*tafsīr*), etc.—that can offer insights into long-term and large-scale developments that took place during the pre-modern period of Islamic history. He is working on two book projects: (1) *“The History of Islam”: An Essay in Digital Humanities* continues the study of al-Ḏahabī’s tremendous collection of biographies, while (2) *The Gift to the Knowledgeable 2.0*, explores cultural production in the Islamic world until the beginning of the 20th century through the study of the *Hadiyyaŧ al-ʿārifīn*, a bibliographical collection composed by Ismāʿīl Bāšā al-Baġdādī (d. 1920).

## Digital projects

* [_2012—ongoing_] **al-Raqmiyyāt: Digital Islamic History** ([www.alraqmiyyat.org](www.alraqmiyyat.org)) Personal research blog that highlights my digital studies of Islamic historical sources in Arabic. The blog is currently in the stage of technical and conceptual transition. Originally built in *WordPress* to highlight my dissertation research progress, it will be re-created with *Jekyll* ([www.jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com)) and will focus on documenting major steps of my digital experiments with 10,000 Arabic texts, highlighting general exploration of both the entire corpus and specific sources. The main goal is to log research progress, share discoveries and provide some guidance to young and senior scholars of Islam and Islamic history interested in employing digital methods in their research.

* [_2013—ongoing_] **Kitāb** (an acronym that also means “book” in Arabic), a cultural history project treating the history of books and cultural memory. It undertakes a far-reaching evaluation of the classical Arabic textual tradition (750—1200) for the purpose of understanding how cultural memory was negotiated and shaped by authors when they created books. Its ingenuity derives from the application of text reuse methods, which detect the copying of texts into other texts and thus enable study of the form and content of the textual tradition. **NB**: Collaborative project led by Sarah Savant (Islamic History, Agha Khan University—London); in collaboration with David Smith (Computer Science, Northeastern), and the Perseus Project; my contribution, among other things, includes the study of **Arabic Biographical Collections** as a genre, with the following main goals: 
	* to study social and religious groups through the analysis of ample biographical data that Arabic sources provide;
	* to provide a detailed overview of biographical collections in Arabic and their authors based on Arabic bio-bibliographical literature; research literature in European languages; surviving manuscripts; printed editions;
	* to provide computational overview in the form of graphs, maps and trees of those collections that are available in electronic format;
	* to trace inter-dependencies between these collections by studying text reuse. 

* [_2014—2015_] **_Ṣūraŧ al-arḍ_**, the geospatial model of the classical Islamic world. **NB**: In collaboration with Cameron Jackson (Senior, double majoring in Arabic and Computer Science, Tufts University). **Main goals**: 
	* to develop a digital gazetteer of Islamic places (_al-Thurayyā_, as a supplement to [pleiades.stoa.org](http://pleiades.stoa.org/)); in collaboration with the team of researchers at the ERC project “The Early Islamic Empire at Work: The View from the Regions Toward the Centre” (PI Stefan Heidemann, Universität Hamburg). The working demo version of _al-Thurayyā_ is available at [maximromanov.github.io](http://maximromanov.github.io/projects/althurayya_02/).
	* to adapt computational framework of [Orbis](http://orbis.stanford.edu/), the Stanford geospatial Network Model of the Roman World (developed by Elijah Meeks and Walter Scheidel), for the historical and geographical data classical available for the Islamic world. The “Islamic Orbis” (_Ṣūraŧ al-arḍ_) will help us to better understand spatial connections within the Islamic world, to visually study geographical and travel literature, and, most importantly, to study ample data from biographical collections by tracing geographies of different social and religious groups.
 

* [_2013–ongoing_] **Islamic History Commons** @ [islamichistorycommons.org](http://islamichistorycommons.org/) **Main goal**: to build an online community (“a commons”) of scholars of early Islamic history, encourage collaborative research and promote digital methods of studying historical and religious sources. **NB**: in collaboration with and under the lead of [Chase Robinson](http://chaserobinson.net/), President and Distinguished Professor of History, The Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

* [_2013–2015_] **Studying Classical Arabic Legacy** @ Tufts University together with Gregory Crane @ Department of Classics & Perseus Project. **Main goals**: 
	* to develop a catalog of digitally available sources in classical Arabic (as an Arabic supplement to [The Perseus Catalog](http://catalog.perseus.org/), to facilitate access to these sources and better understand what Arabic sources are available and what sources have been overlooked.
	* to develop courses for teaching classical Arabic with the use of computational tools (e.g., [Alpheios Reading Tools](http://alpheios.net/)) in order to enhance and speed learning process;
	* to develop courses for studying specific classical sources in Arabic and in English translation in order to generate new knowledge about the Islamic world (research courses / digital projects).  

* [_2008_] **Reviews of/Manuals for Digital Libraries of Arabic and Persian Sources** together with Michael Bonner, University of Michigan **Main goal**: to provide scholars of Islam with reviews of/manuals for available digital libraries; to conduct a workshop on how to use these resources. **Results**: reviews of over 10 digital libraries have been prepared as instructional materials for the Workshop on **Electronic Libraries/Databases of Arabic and Islamic sources** (conducted in May 2009 @ University of Michigan), which include the following (**‡** based on materials prepared earlier with Stanislav Prozorov, SPbIOS/IOM of RAS. _Reviews/Manuals are available upon request_):  
	* _al-Muʿǧam al-fiḳhī_, Qumm, Iran; **‡**
	* _al-Mawsūʿaŧ al-šiʿriyyaŧ_, Abu Dhabi, OAE (available @ [www.alraqmiyyat.org](http://alraqmiyyat.org/));
	* a series of libraries by al-Turāṯ, Amman, Jordan;
	* _Ǧāmiʿ_, Ahl al-bayt Institute, Iran.

	[_Abstract_] A project in the digital humanities, the dissertation explores methods of computational text analysis. Relying on text-mining techniques to extract meaningful data from unstructured text, the study offers an effective and flexible method for the analysis of Arabic biographical collections, the most valuable source for the social history of the pre-modern Islamic world. It uses the largest collection, “The History of Islam” of al-Ḏahabī (d. 1348), as a case-study of applying the new method and shows how almost 30,000 biographies can be studied as a whole.
	
	A step toward finding a viable solution for studying the entire digital corpus of classical Islamic texts (400 mln. words), Chapter I offers a detailed explanation of “computational reading” that was built upon existing digital approaches from a variety of disciplines. Chapter II models big data extracted from the main source to further our understanding of the social geography of the Islamic world and its major social transformations, simultaneously providing an important background for the next chapter. Chapter III applies the devised method to the study of Islamic preaching from chronological, geographical and social perspectives that have been overlooked in the academic treatment of this subject. Largely an exploratory overview, it traces long-term changes in preaching practices as well as statuses of preachers within the Islamic élites. This chapter demonstrates how exactly computational reading can contribute to the studies of specific phenomena and practices. The final section overviews broad prospects of the further application of “computational reading” to a variety of genres of pre-modern Arabic literature.

## Dissertation: *From Introduction*

My dissertation is a project in the digital humanities. Over the past few years “digital humanities” became an extremely overused buzzword, and one often gets a feeling that, as a Russian saying goes, only the lazy do not speak of themselves as digital humanists. For this reason, some clarifications are in order. The digital humanities still remains a vaguely defined field[^fn1] and DH studies range widely from theoretical inquiries into possible effects of technological developments on the humanities at large to the development and application of digital methods to traditional sources. While the prevailing majority of digital humanists prefer to contribute to the area of theoretical inquiries, this dissertation is primarily about studying traditional sources with non-traditional methods.

The initial plan was to write a dissertation on the history of “public preaching” (*waʿẓ*). My sociological background and my overall interest in Arabic biographical literature, which was firmly instilled in me by my Russian mentor [Professor Stanislav M. Prozorov](http://orientalstudies.ru/eng/index.php?option=com_personalities&Itemid=74&person=8), steered me toward the history of “public preaching” through the analysis of biographical collections. In order to study preachers as a social group it was necessary to study *all* their biographies. Unfortunately, conventional close reading was of little help and a different method was necessary. In order to understand how this social group fitted into Islamic society, it was necessary to know what Islamic society was, i.e. it was necessary to study *all* other biographies as well.[^fn2] Only this would allow to place preachers into a wider context of Islamic society as it is represented on the pages of biographical collections. This also required a different method.

Graduate students in our field often learn additional languages of the Islamicate world in order to advance their research. In order to solve my methodological issues I needed not a different language, but a different *kind* of language—a language that would allow me to work with texts in a radically different manner. It so happened that learning scripting languages—in my case Python and R—was the answer. These *formal* languages indeed allow one to read texts in a completely different way, no matter in what language they are, and no matter how long they are. They enhance and augment our ability to read by allowing us to work with practically unlimited volumes of text. They allowed me to pull together almost 30,000 biographies from al-Ḏahabī’s *Taʾrīḫ al-islām*, the largest biographical collection that became the backbone of my study, and start studying them as a whole.

Since digital methods have not yet entered the domain of Islamic studies, the first part of the dissertation offers a detailed explanation of “computational reading” that has been developed over the past two years. This method is built upon existing digital techniques and approaches that were picked from a variety of disciplines and adapted to the analysis of Arabic biographical collections. I fully realize that the reader might find the exposition of the method painfully technical, but since the method is essential for the entire study and largely unprecedented, its inner workings must be explained in sufficient details. Most importantly, I hope that this part will provide young scholars who are willing to step into the still uncharted terrain of digital methods of textual analysis with a desperately needed road map. Something that I, to my own misfortune, did not have.

The first part is also meant to be a step toward finding a viable approach for studying the vast digital corpus of classical Islamic texts which keeps on growing practically by the minute. If Islamicists do not find a way to deal with this big issue, eventually someone else will. In this light it is worth drawing attention to an experimental study conducted by a group of *information scientists*. Published in an American academic journal,[^fn3] this “computer study of the reliability of Arabic stories” attempts to evaluate the reliability of chains of transmitters (sing. *isnād*) in Prophetic reports (sing. *ḥadīṯ*) using contemporary information reliability theories. Although these scientists are far from producing anything as appealing to reading public as, for example, *Guns, Germs, and Steel*,[^4_416] there are no reasons to believe that our field will forever remain immune to those who might want to follow in the footsteps of Jared Diamond, a biologist-turn-historian.

The second part is on modeling. Extracted with digital methods, “big data” still need to be re-organized in some coherent manner in order to be useful for analysis. Modeling is a way to achieve this. As clearly defined systems of assumptions about different kinds of data and their interrelations, models are designed to provide explanations for complex processes.[^5_416] Thus, this part models big data extracted from al-Ḏahabī’s *Taʾrīḫ al-islām* to further our understanding of the social geography of the Islamic world and major social transformations that the Muslim community underwent in the course of its early history. Although largely a road map for further research, this part provides an important chronological, geographical and social background for the last part of the dissertation.

The third part is an application of the devised method to the study of Islamic preaching. It focuses on an exploratory overview of all major forms of Islamic preaching as they feature on the electronic pages of my corpus that covers about 700 years of Islamic history. Partially determined by the current state of the development of computational reading, this part studies the major forms of Islamic preaching from chronological, geographical and social perspectives that have been largely overlooked in the academic treatment of this subject. The choice of establishing the overview, instead of trying to find answers to particular historical questions, was deliberate. Working with big data makes it abundantly clear that there are too many unknowns and that asking specific questions without knowing what is and what is not in the data only leads to wrong answers. At this stage, “exploratory analysis” is much more crucial than specific inquiries. One of the major goals of this part is also to demonstrate how exactly computational reading can contribute to the studies of specific phenomena and practices in the pre-modern Islamic world.

The three parts of the dissertation build upon each other, but ultimately can be treated as separate studies.

### Dissertation Afterword: Further prospects

My dissertation, *Computational Reading of Arabic Biographical Collections with Special Reference to Preaching in the Sunnī World (661-1300 ce)*, turned out to be more on the method of computational reading rather than on anything else, but the results are most exciting in terms of prospects that this method opens. After less than two years of development this method allows getting almost instantaneous insights into a great number of historical issues. Although technologically the approach has been developed practically from scratch, in spirit it follows in the footsteps of the quantitative method that has been used by the scholars of Islam since the 1970s. In its current state the method is best suited for analyzing biographical data from social, chronological and geographical perspectives, yet the complexity of analytical tasks can be increased *ad infinitum*. Computational reading is flexible, scalable and fast beyond comparison with conventional methods. Dwelling on these properties should offer a glimpse into the prospects of its further implementation.

The flexibility of computational reading allows asking various historical questions by designing analytical algorithms of any complexity. (It should be stressed that even though the method puts a lot of emphasis on the use of technology, its effectiveness implementation requires traditional training in Near Eastern studies.) Although the emphasis in the dissertation was primarily on the analysis of biographical data (dates, names and toponyms), computational reading also allows for the analysis of complex textual evidence.

	<figcaption>Age statements from <i>Taʾrīḫ al-islām</i>. The left image shows the chronological fluctuation of the average lifespan, while the image on the right shows the chronological distribution of age statements (darker areas mean more age statements).</figcaption>
</figure>

For example, we can get a glimpse into the age structure of Islamic élites through the computational analysis of age statement that often occur in biographies. Analyzing most frequent types of such statements in *Taʾrīḫ al-islām*, my experimental algorithm yields ages for over 5,100 individuals and shows that during the period of almost seven centuries the average lifespan fluctuated between 67 and 80 lunar years (Age Statements, *left*), clearly going down when age statements become more and more frequent, after c. 350/962 CE (Age Statements, *right*). Onomastic and toponymic *synsets* that allow re-grouping data using social, religious and geographical parameters may shed light on the age structure of different social groups and local communities. With minor modifications, this analytical algorithm can be applied to other sources as well. For example, the *Hadiyyaŧ al-ʿārifīn* offers age data on about 1,650 Islamic authors (out of approximately 8,800) and a very cursory glance at the results shows that the longevity was indeed characteristic of religious scholars,[^0_787] while most of the short-lived authors are usually found in the field of poetry and fine literature, where talent and audacity seem to have been more important than networks and perseverance. Ability to collect such data from numerous biographical collections will help to advance the study of the demography of the Islamic world.

In a similar manner, algorithms can be devised for a more complex analysis of onomastic data that would allow, for example, reproducing Bulliet’s study of conversion.[^1_787] The very fact that this study is still criticized[^2_787] after more than three decades from its publication shows that Bulliet’s model of conversion cannot be discarded through a critique of where it fails, if otherwise it still remains plausible and coherent. The old model will remain standing until an equally plausible alternative can be offered.  The flexibility of computational reading will allow re-testing the original model of conversion on new biographical collections, experimenting with its variations and developing a new one.

The emphasis in the dissertation was primarily on biographical collections, however, computational reading can be applied to texts of any genre, although it does work best for texts that show structural regularities of some kind. For example, one can design algorithms that will allow tracing the usage of Qurʾānic verses over the entire digital corpus of Islamic sources. Such a large-scale study of how the Qurʾān was quoted and interpreted by different authors will allow to improve our understanding of how different aspects of the Islamic scripture were coming to prominence depending on historical circumstances. The same can be done for Prophetic traditions (sing. *ḥadīṯ*), where computational reading will be particularly helpful for the analysis of the chains of transmitters. Compendia of legal decisions (sing. *fatwá*) can also be analyzed in the same manner and the exploratory analysis of possible correlations between the topics of legal decisions, locales and periods will most likely reveal unexpected commonalities and differences between regional communities of Muslims, as well as offer a unique perspective on the long-term regional development of Islamic law. Likewise, interesting experiments can be designed for the study of classical Arabic poetry. Considering that the meter can be identified computationally,[^3_787] the scholars of Arabic poetry can look for correlations between meters and themes, and, of course, put their discoveries in geographical and chronological perspectives.[^4_787]

The scalability of computational reading allows testing whether the same historical questions yield similar results when asked of new sources—this is done by applying existing analytical algorithms to new sources. For example, the already devised complex means of identifying preachers and passages relevant to preaching can be effectively applied to local biographical collections and local histories, which will allow us to get a more detailed idea of the chronology of different preaching practices in particular regions of the Islamic world, and simultaneously test whether regional representation in *Taʾrīḫ al-islām* corresponds to that of local sources.

Computational reading is fast. It does take a great deal of time to put together the essentials—devise algorithms, compile *synsets*, reformat sources—but when they are ready, the results can be produced almost instantaneously. The results can be easily regenerated if analytical algorithms require adjustments or new sources added to the corpus; and it does not matter whether analytical algorithms are applied to a single text or the entire digital corpus of classical Arabic that already significantly exceeds 400 million words. In most cases the results come in volumes that are significant enough to trace historical patterns.

</figure>

The volume of structured data that has been generated so far from Taʾrīḫ al-islām alone is sufficient for dozens of studies that will allow advancing our understanding of the social history of the pre-modern Islamic world. Most of these data remained outside this dissertation project, but to give an idea of these “byproducts,” we can take a quick look at the results for the major Sunnī legal schools. Figure above shows that each school had a distinct geographical network. In and of themselves these geographies are hardly surprising and largely agree with what the students of Islam have already discovered over the last century or so. (It is worth highlighting, however, that these maps are but a circumstantial result of the two-year research by a graduate student). At the same time, reformatted into graphs and chronological maps—similar to the ones that were used in the part on preaching and preachers—these data can give the scholars of Islam a much more subtle picture of how these geographical networks were changing over time, where and when they flourished, stagnated, and declined. The use of hierarchical lists of geographical entities—toponymic *synsets*—allows taking a more detailed view of these geographical networks and analyze connections not only between provinces, but also between urban centers and even city quarters. By putting data on all four legal schools on the same chronological maps we can get a glimpse into how these schools were coexisting with each other in different regional clusters. Figure below should give an idea of how the “relative weights” of the schools were changing over time in major regional clusters during the period of 470–670/1078–1272 CE.

	<figcaption><em>“Relative Weights” of the Legal Schools in Regional Clusters. <strong>Legend:</strong> Solid core shows individuals  <em>strongly associated with regions in question; semi-transparent husks show individuals who visited regions in question.</em></em></figcaption>
</figure>

Needless to say that in the same manner one can trace the chronology and geography of any social group that can be identified in the sources through relevant onomastic elements or more complex textual descriptions. One of the major advantages of the computational approach is that instead of artificially imposing chronological and geographical boundaries, one can discover periods and regions that are important to specific phenomena, practices, or social groups.

Somewhat ironically, the advantages of computational reading pose problems. The volume of results generated with this method is overwhelming. The visualization of data with tables, graphs, and maps is helpful for getting meaningful insights into findings, but comprehension and interpretation of these data will require collaborative efforts and decades of more traditional research. Fortunately, computational reading also allows marshaling all relevant textual evidence for close reading.
