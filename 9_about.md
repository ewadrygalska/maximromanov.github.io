<strong><a href="https://tufts.academia.edu/MaximRomanov/CurriculumVitae">Detailed CV in PDF</a><br /> </strong>


My name is Maxim Romanov. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the Department of Classics & [Perseus Project][1] at [Tufts University][2]. I have finished my PhD in [Near Eastern Studies][3] (Arabic and Islamic Studies) at the [University of Michigan][4], working under the mentorship of Professor [Alexander D. Knysh][5]. My main interest is computational reading of classical Arabic sources. Although at the moment I am primarily interested in the analysis of biographical collections and chronicles, I hope to soon expand my research on other genres of classical Arabic literature, mainly large volume collections<sup><a href="#footnote_0_416" id="identifier_0_416" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For example, biobibliographical collections, poetic anthologies, collections&nbsp;of traditions (ḥadīth), collections of legal decisions (fatw&aacute;s), interpretations of the Qurʾān (tafsīr), etc.">1</a></sup> that can offer insights into long-term and large-scale developments that took place during the pre-modern period of Islamic history.

**About the Dissertation: Computational Reading of Arabic Biographical Collections with Special Reference to Preaching in the Sunni World (661-1300 ce) [[available online][6]]**

My dissertation is a project in the digital humanities. Over the past few years “digital humanities” became an extremely overused buzzword, and one often gets a feeling that, as a Russian saying goes, only the lazy do not speak of themselves as digital humanists. For this reason, some clarifications are in order. The digital humanities still remains a vaguely defined field<sup><a href="#footnote_1_416" id="identifier_1_416" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Burdick, Anne, Johanna Drucker, Peter Lunenfeld, Todd Presner, and Jeffrey Schnapp. Digital_Humanities. The MIT Press, 2012, especially Chapter 4. Provocations: A Short Guide to the Digital_Humanities.">2</a></sup> and DH studies range widely from theoretical inquiries into possible effects of technological developments on the humanities at large to the development and application of digital methods to traditional sources. While the prevailing majority of digital humanists prefer to contribute to the area of theoretical inquiries, this dissertation is primarily about studying traditional sources with non-traditional methods.

The initial plan was to write a dissertation on the history of “public preaching” (*waʿẓ*). My sociological background and my overall interest in Arabic biographical literature, which was firmly instilled in me by my Russian mentor <a title="Professor Prozorov's Profile at www.orientalstudies.ru" href="http://orientalstudies.ru/eng/index.php?option=com_personalities&Itemid=74&person=8" target="_blank">Professor Stanislav M. Prozorov</a>, steered me toward the history of “public preaching” through the analysis of biographical collections. In order to study preachers as a social group it was necessary to study *all* their biographies. Unfortunately, conventional close reading was of little help and a different method was necessary. In order to understand how this social group fitted into Islamic society, it was necessary to know what Islamic society was, i.e. it was necessary to study *all* other biographies as well.<sup><a href="#footnote_2_416" id="identifier_2_416" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It is still hard to speak about the society at large, but I hope that methodologically I was able to make a few steps in the right direction that would allow us to better understand the Islamic &eacute;lites that are described in biographical collections.">3</a></sup> Only this would allow to place preachers into a wider context of Islamic society as it is represented on the pages of biographical collections. This also required a different method.

Graduate students in our field often learn additional languages of the Islamicate world in order to advance their research. In order to solve my methodological issues I needed not a different language, but a different *kind* of language—a language that would allow me to work with texts in a radically different manner. It so happened that learning scripting languages—in my case Python and R—was the answer. These *formal* languages indeed allow one to read texts in a completely different way, no matter in what language they are, and no matter how long they are. They enhance and augment our ability to read by allowing us to work with practically unlimited volumes of text. They allowed me to pull together almost 30,000 biographies from al-Dhahabī’s *Taʾrīkh al-islām*, the largest biographical collection that became the backbone of my study, and start studying them as a whole.

Since digital methods have not yet entered the domain of Islamic studies, the first part of the dissertation offers a detailed explanation of “computational reading” that has been developed over the past two years. This method is built upon existing digital techniques and approaches that were picked from a variety of disciplines and adapted to the analysis of Arabic biographical collections. I fully realize that the reader might find the exposition of the method painfully technical, but since the method is essential for the entire study and largely unprecedented, its inner workings must be explained in sufficient details. Most importantly, I hope that this part will provide young scholars who are willing to step into the still uncharted terrain of digital methods of textual analysis with a desperately needed road map. Something that I, to my own misfortune, did not have.

The first part is also meant to be a step toward finding a viable approach for studying the vast digital corpus of classical Islamic texts which keeps on growing practically by the minute. If Islamicists do not find a way to deal with this big issue, eventually someone else will. In this light it is worth drawing attention to an experimental study conducted by a group of *information scientists*. Published in an American academic journal,<sup><a href="#footnote_3_416" id="identifier_3_416" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Bounhas, Ibrahim, Bilel Elayeb, Fabrice Evrard, and Yahya Slimani. &ldquo;Toward a Computer Study of the Reliability of Arabic Stories.&rdquo; Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (2010): 1686&ndash;1705.">4</a></sup> this “computer study of the reliability of Arabic stories” attempts to evaluate the reliability of chains of transmitters (*isnād*s) in Prophetic reports (*ḥadīth*s) using contemporary information reliability theories. Although these scientists are far from producing anything as appealing to reading public as, for example, *Guns, Germs, and Steel*,<sup><a href="#footnote_4_416" id="identifier_4_416" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Diamond, Jared. Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. 1st ed. W. W. Norton & Company, 2005 (first published in 1999).">5</a></sup> there are no reasons to believe that our field will forever remain immune to those who might want to follow in the footsteps of Jared Diamond, a biologist-turn-historian.

The second part is on modeling. Extracted with digital methods, “big data” still need to be re-organized in some coherent manner in order to be useful for analysis. Modeling is a way to achieve this. As clearly defined systems of assumptions about different kinds of data and their interrelations, models are designed to provide explanations for complex processes.<sup><a href="#footnote_5_416" id="identifier_5_416" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For valuable examples of modeling &ldquo;big data,&rdquo; see: Moretti, Franco. Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History. Verso, 2007; Morris, Ian. The Measure of Civilization: How Social Development Decides the Fate of Nations. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013; also see ORBIS: The Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World (http://orbis.stanford.edu/), developed by Walter Scheidel and Elijah Meeks. In the field of Islamic studies: Bulliet, Richard W. Conversion to Islam in the Medieval Period: An Essay in Quantitative History. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1979.">6</a></sup> Thus, this part models big data extracted from al-Dhahabī’s *Taʾrīkh al-islām* to further our understanding of the social geography of the Islamic world and major social transformations that the Muslim community underwent in the course of its early history. Although largely a road map for further research, this part provides an important chronological, geographical and social background for the last part of the dissertation.

The third part is an application of the devised method to the study of Islamic preaching. It focuses on an exploratory overview of all major forms of Islamic preaching as they feature on the electronic pages of my corpus that covers about 700 years of Islamic history. Partially determined by the current state of the development of computational reading, this part studies the major forms of Islamic preaching from chronological, geographical and social perspectives that have been largely overlooked in the academic treatment of this subject. The choice of establishing the overview, instead of trying to find answers to particular historical questions, was deliberate. Working with big data makes it abundantly clear that there are too many unknowns and that asking specific questions without knowing what is and what is not in the data only leads to wrong answers. At this stage, “exploratory analysis” is much more crucial than specific inquiries. One of the major goals of this part is also to demonstrate how exactly computational reading can contribute to the studies of specific phenomena and practices in the pre-modern Islamic world.

The three parts of the dissertation build upon each other, but ultimately can be treated as separate studies.

**Further Prospects**

My dissertation turned out to be more on the method of computational reading rather than on anything else, but the results are most exciting in terms of prospects that this method opens. After less than two years of development this method allows getting almost instantaneous insights into a great number of historical issues. Although technologically the approach has been developed practically from scratch, in spirit it follows in the footsteps of the quantitative method that has been used by the scholars of Islam since the 1970s. In its current state the method is best suited for analyzing biographical data from social, chronological and geographical perspectives, yet the complexity of analytical tasks can be increased *ad infinitum*. Computational reading is flexible, scalable and fast beyond comparison with conventional methods. Dwelling on these properties should offer a glimpse into the prospects of its further implementation.

The flexibility of computational reading allows asking various historical questions by designing analytical algorithms of any complexity. (It should be stressed that even though the method puts a lot of emphasis on the use of technology, its effectiveness implementation requires traditional training in Near Eastern studies.) Although the emphasis in the dissertation was primarily on the analysis of biographical data (dates, names and toponyms), computational reading also allows for the analysis of complex textual evidence.

[<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-783" title="AgeStructure" alt="" src="http://alraqmiyyat.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/AgeStructure-1024x303.png" width="500" height="147" />][7]

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>Age statements from </em>Taʾrīkh al-islām<em>. The left image shows the chronological<br /> fluctuation of the average lifespan, while the image on the right shows the<br /> chronological distribution of age statements<br /> (darker areas mean more age statements).</em>
</p>

For example, we can get a glimpse into the age structure of Islamic élites through the computational analysis of age statement that often occur in biographies. Analyzing most frequent types of such statements in *Taʾrīkh al-islām*, my experimental algorithm yields ages for over 5,100 individuals and shows that during the period of almost seven centuries the average lifespan fluctuated between 67 and 80 lunar years (Age Statements, *left*), clearly going down when age statements become more and more frequent, after c. 350/962 CE (Age Statements, *right*). Onomastic and toponymic *synsets* that allow re-grouping data using social, religious and geographical parameters may shed light on the age structure of different social groups and local communities. With minor modifications, this analytical algorithm can be applied to other sources as well. For example, the *Hadīyat al-ʿārifīn* offers age data on about 1,650 Islamic authors (out of approximately 8,800) and a very cursory glance at the results shows that the longevity was indeed characteristic of religious scholars,<sup><a href="#footnote_6_416" id="identifier_6_416" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Bulliet determines an average lifespan of 78 lunar years (Bulliet, Richard W. &ldquo;A Quantitative Approach to Medieval Muslim Biographical Dictionaries.&rdquo; Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient 13, no. 2 (April 1, 1970), p. 200); Nawas gives 80 lunar years (Nawas, John. &ldquo;Development of the Islamic Religious Sciences.&rdquo; al-Masaq 11 (1999), p. 161, also see fn. 8 for more references); and Şent&uuml;rk&mdash;79.82 (Şent&uuml;rk, Recep. Narrative Social Structure: Anatomy of the Hadith Transmission Network, 610-1505. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 2005, p. 65). In all three cases the emphasis is strongly on the religious &eacute;lites, and even more so&mdash;on the transmitters of ḥadīth, for whom longevity was one of the most important characteristics; the coverage of Taʾrīkh al-islām is, of course, not limited to any specific group.">7</a></sup> while most of the short-lived authors are usually found in the field of poetry and fine literature, where talent and audacity seem to have been more important than networks and perseverance. Ability to collect such data from numerous biographical collections will help to advance the study of the demography of the Islamic world.

In a similar manner, algorithms can be devised for a more complex analysis of onomastic data that would allow, for example, reproducing Bulliet’s study of conversion.<sup><a href="#footnote_7_416" id="identifier_7_416" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Bulliet, Richard W. Conversion to Islam in the Medieval Period: An Essay in Quantitative History. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1979.">8</a></sup> The very fact that this study is still criticized<sup><a href="#footnote_8_416" id="identifier_8_416" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Most recently: Wasserstein, David J. &ldquo;Where Have All the Converts Gone? Difficulties in the Study of Conversion to Islam in al-Andalus.&rdquo; Al-Qanṭara 33, no. 2 (February 11, 2013): 325&ndash;342.">9</a></sup> after more than three decades from its publication shows that Bulliet’s model of conversion cannot be discarded through a critique of where it fails, if otherwise it still remains plausible and coherent. The old model will remain standing until an equally plausible alternative can be offered. The flexibility of computational reading will allow re-testing the original model of conversion on new biographical collections, experimenting with its variations and developing a new one.

<span style="line-height: 1.7;">The emphasis in the dissertation was primarily on biographical collections, however, computational reading can be applied to texts of any genre, although it does work best for texts that show structural regularities of some kind. For example, one can design algorithms that will allow tracing the usage of Qurʾānic verses over the entire digital corpus of Islamic sources. Such a large-scale study of how the Qurʾān was quoted and interpreted by different authors will allow to improve our understanding of how different aspects of the Islamic scripture were coming to prominence depending on historical circumstances. The same can be done for Prophetic traditions (sing. </span><em style="line-height: 1.7;">ḥadīth</em><span style="line-height: 1.7;">), where computational reading will be particularly helpful for the analysis of the chains of transmitters. Compendia of legal decisions (sing. </span><em style="line-height: 1.7;">fatwá</em><span style="line-height: 1.7;">) can also be analyzed in the same manner and the exploratory analysis of possible correlations between the topics of legal decisions, locales and periods will most likely reveal unexpected commonalities and differences between regional communities of Muslims, as well as offer a unique perspective on the long-term regional development of Islamic law. Likewise, interesting experiments can be designed for the study of classical Arabic poetry. Considering that the meter can be identified computationally,<sup><a href="#footnote_9_416" id="identifier_9_416" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For one such tool see, The Encyclopaedia of Arabic Poetry by Cultural Foundation, Abu Dhabi (UAE), reviewed in details by Michael Bonner and Maxim Romanov at www.alraqmiyyat.org.">10</a></sup> the scholars of Arabic poetry can look for correlations between meters and themes, and, of course, put their discoveries in geographical and chronological perspectives.<sup><a href="#footnote_10_416" id="identifier_10_416" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Similar studies in the history of English fiction have already yielded a number of interesting and unexpected discoveries. For example, Jockers, Matthew L. Macroanalysis: Digital Methods and Literary History. 1st Edition. University of Illinois Press, 2013; Moretti, Franco. Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History. Verso, 2007; Moretti, Franco. Distant Reading. 1st ed. Verso, 2013.">11</a></sup></span>

<span style="line-height: 1.7;">The scalability of computational reading allows testing whether the same historical questions yield similar results when asked of new sources—this is done by applying existing analytical algorithms to new sources. For example, the already devised complex means of identifying preachers and passages relevant to preaching can be effectively applied to local biographical collections and local histories, which will allow us to get a more detailed idea of the chronology of different preaching practices in particular regions of the Islamic world, and simultaneously test whether regional representation in </span><em style="line-height: 1.7;">Taʾrīkh al-islām</em><span style="line-height: 1.7;"> corresponds to that of local sources.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.7;">Computational reading is fast. It does take a great deal of time to put together the essentials—devise algorithms, compile </span><em style="line-height: 1.7;">synsets</em><span style="line-height: 1.7;">, reformat sources—but when they are ready, the results can be produced almost instantaneously. The results can be easily regenerated if analytical algorithms require adjustments or new sources added to the corpus; and it does not matter whether analytical algorithms are applied to a single text or the entire digital corpus of classical Arabic that already significantly exceeds 400 million words. In most cases the results come in volumes that are significant enough to trace historical patterns.</span>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>Geographical Networks of the Legal Schools. <strong>NB</strong>: each maps has its own scale.</em>
</p>

<span style="line-height: 1.7;">The volume of structured data that has been generated so far from </span><em style="line-height: 1.7;">Taʾrīkh al-islām</em><span style="line-height: 1.7;"> alone is sufficient for dozens of studies that will allow advancing our understanding of the social history of the pre-modern Islamic world. Most of these data remained outside this dissertation project, but to give the reader an idea of these “byproducts,” we can take a quick look at the results for the major Sunnī legal schools. Figure above shows that each school had a distinct geographical network. In and of themselves these geographies are hardly surprising and largely agree with what the students of Islam have already discovered over the last century or so (It is worth highlighting, however, that these maps are but a circumstantial result of the two-year research by a graduate student). At the same time, reformatted into graphs and chronological maps—similar to the ones that were used in the part on preaching and preachers—these data can give the scholars of Islam a much more subtle picture of how these geographical networks were changing over time, where and when they flourished, stagnated, and declined. The use of hierarchical lists of geographical entities—toponymic </span><em style="line-height: 1.7;">synsets</em><span style="line-height: 1.7;">—allows taking a more detailed view of these geographical networks and analyze connections not only between provinces, but also between urban centers and even city quarters. By putting data on all four legal schools on the same chronological maps we can get a glimpse into how these schools were coexisting with each other in different regional clusters. Figure below should give an idea of how the “relative weights” of the schools were changing over time in major regional clusters during the period of 470–670/1078–1272 CE.</span>

[<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-781" title="RelativeWeights" alt="" src="http://alraqmiyyat.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RelativeWeights-1024x542.png" width="500" height="264" />][8]

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>“Relative Weights” of the Legal Schools in Regional Clusters.</em>
</p>

Needless to say that in the same manner one can trace the chronology and geography of any social group that can be identified in the sources through relevant onomastic elements or more complex textual descriptions. One of the major advantages of the computational approach is that instead of artificially imposing chronological and geographical boundaries, one can discover periods and regions that are important to specific phenomena, practices, or social groups.

Somewhat ironically, the advantages of computational reading pose problems. The volume of results generated with this method is overwhelming. The visualization of data with tables, graphs, and maps is helpful for getting meaningful insights into findings, but comprehension and interpretation of these data will require collaborative efforts and decades of more traditional research. Fortunately, computational reading also allows marshaling all relevant textual evidence for close reading.
