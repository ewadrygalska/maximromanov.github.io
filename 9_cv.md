## Digital projects

* [_2012—ongoing_] **al-Raqmiyyāt: Digital Islamic History** ([www.alraqmiyyat.org](www.alraqmiyyat.org)) Personal research blog that highlights my digital studies of Islamic historical sources in Arabic. The blog is currently in the stage of technical and conceptual transition. Originally built in *WordPress* to highlight my dissertation research progress, it will be re-created with *Jekyll* ([www.jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com)) and will focus on documenting major steps of my digital experiments with 10,000 Arabic texts, highlighting general exploration of both the entire corpus and specific sources. The main goal is to log research progress, share discoveries and provide some guidance to young and senior scholars of Islam and Islamic history interested in employing digital methods in their research.

* [_2013—ongoing_] **Kitāb** (an acronym that also means “book” in Arabic), a cultural history project treating the history of books and cultural memory. It undertakes a far-reaching evaluation of the classical Arabic textual tradition (750—1200) for the purpose of understanding how cultural memory was negotiated and shaped by authors when they created books. Its ingenuity derives from the application of text reuse methods, which detect the copying of texts into other texts and thus enable study of the form and content of the textual tradition. **NB**: Collaborative project led by Sarah Savant (Islamic History, Agha Khan University—London); in collaboration with David Smith (Computer Science, Northeastern), and the Perseus Project; my contribution, among other things, includes the study of **Arabic Biographical Collections** as a genre, with the following main goals: 
	* to study social and religious groups through the analysis of ample biographical data that Arabic sources provide;
	* to provide a detailed overview of biographical collections in Arabic and their authors based on Arabic bio-bibliographical literature; research literature in European languages; surviving manuscripts; printed editions;
	* to provide computational overview in the form of graphs, maps and trees of those collections that are available in electronic format;
	* to trace inter-dependencies between these collections by studying text reuse. 

* [_2014—2015_] **_Ṣūraŧ al-arḍ_**, the geospatial model of the classical Islamic world. **NB**: In collaboration with Cameron Jackson (Senior, double majoring in Arabic and Computer Science, Tufts University). **Main goals**: 
	* to develop a digital gazetteer of Islamic places (_al-Thurayyā_, as a supplement to [pleiades.stoa.org](http://pleiades.stoa.org/)); in collaboration with the team of researchers at the ERC project “The Early Islamic Empire at Work: The View from the Regions Toward the Centre” (PI Stefan Heidemann, Universität Hamburg). The working demo version of _al-Thurayyā_ is available at [maximromanov.github.io](http://maximromanov.github.io/projects/althurayya_02/).
	* to adapt computational framework of [Orbis](http://orbis.stanford.edu/), the Stanford geospatial Network Model of the Roman World (developed by Elijah Meeks and Walter Scheidel), for the historical and geographical data classical available for the Islamic world. The “Islamic Orbis” (_Ṣūraŧ al-arḍ_) will help us to better understand spatial connections within the Islamic world, to visually study geographical and travel literature, and, most importantly, to study ample data from biographical collections by tracing geographies of different social and religious groups.
 

* [_2013–ongoing_] **Islamic History Commons** @ [islamichistorycommons.org](http://islamichistorycommons.org/) **Main goal**: to build an online community (“a commons”) of scholars of early Islamic history, encourage collaborative research and promote digital methods of studying historical and religious sources. **NB**: in collaboration with and under the lead of [Chase Robinson](http://chaserobinson.net/), President and Distinguished Professor of History, The Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

* [_2013–2015_] **Studying Classical Arabic Legacy** @ Tufts University together with Gregory Crane @ Department of Classics & Perseus Project. **Main goals**: 
	* to develop a catalog of digitally available sources in classical Arabic (as an Arabic supplement to [The Perseus Catalog](http://catalog.perseus.org/), to facilitate access to these sources and better understand what Arabic sources are available and what sources have been overlooked.
	* to develop courses for teaching classical Arabic with the use of computational tools (e.g., [Alpheios Reading Tools](http://alpheios.net/)) in order to enhance and speed learning process;
	* to develop courses for studying specific classical sources in Arabic and in English translation in order to generate new knowledge about the Islamic world (research courses / digital projects).  

* [_2008_] **Reviews of/Manuals for Digital Libraries of Arabic and Persian Sources** together with Michael Bonner, University of Michigan **Main goal**: to provide scholars of Islam with reviews of/manuals for available digital libraries; to conduct a workshop on how to use these resources. **Results**: reviews of over 10 digital libraries have been prepared as instructional materials for the Workshop on **Electronic Libraries/Databases of Arabic and Islamic sources** (conducted in May 2009 @ University of Michigan), which include the following (**‡** based on materials prepared earlier with Stanislav Prozorov, SPbIOS/IOM of RAS. _Reviews/Manuals are available upon request_):  
	* _al-Muʿǧam al-fiḳhī_, Qumm, Iran; **‡**
	* _al-Mawsūʿaŧ al-šiʿriyyaŧ_, Abu Dhabi, OAE (available @ [www.alraqmiyyat.org](http://alraqmiyyat.org/));
	* a series of libraries by al-Turāṯ, Amman, Jordan;
	* _Ǧāmiʿ_, Ahl al-bayt Institute, Iran.

* **Computational Reading of Arabic Biographical Collections with Special Reference to Preaching in the Sunnī World (661–1300 ce)**

	[_Abstract_] A project in the digital humanities, the dissertation explores methods of computational text analysis. Relying on text-mining techniques to extract meaningful data from unstructured text, the study offers an effective and flexible method for the analysis of Arabic biographical collections, the most valuable source for the social history of the pre-modern Islamic world. It uses the largest collection, “The History of Islam” of al-Ḏahabī (d. 1348), as a case-study of applying the new method and shows how almost 30,000 biographies can be studied as a whole.
	
	A step toward finding a viable solution for studying the entire digital corpus of classical Islamic texts (400 mln. words), Chapter I offers a detailed explanation of “computational reading” that was built upon existing digital approaches from a variety of disciplines. Chapter II models big data extracted from the main source to further our understanding of the social geography of the Islamic world and its major social transformations, simultaneously providing an important background for the next chapter. Chapter III applies the devised method to the study of Islamic preaching from chronological, geographical and social perspectives that have been overlooked in the academic treatment of this subject. Largely an exploratory overview, it traces long-term changes in preaching practices as well as statuses of preachers within the Islamic élites. This chapter demonstrates how exactly computational reading can contribute to the studies of specific phenomena and practices. The final section overviews broad prospects of the further application of “computational reading” to a variety of genres of pre-modern Arabic literature.
	
	The dissertation heavily relies on the visual display of information in the form of graphs, charts, maps, and tables that are used in the main body and supplied in Appendices. [More details...](http://alraqmiyyat.org/intro/)
