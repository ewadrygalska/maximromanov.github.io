\section{Course Description \and Syllabus}

\newthought{What has Baghdad to do with Damascus---or with Rabat?} We see the Islamic world as a series of nations on the map of the twenty-first century, but the real map has little to do with the boundaries of current nation states and much to do with the links that structure the Islamic world that began to be forged fourteen hundred years ago. Through the study of the detailed descriptions contained in the work \textit{The Best Division for Knowledge of the Regions} by al-Muqaddas"i (10\thh century), the last representative of the classical school of Arab geography, students will examine the geographical, economic, political, religious and cultural factors that kept this world together and pulled it apart. By encountering the structure of the Islamic world of the past, students will gain an invaluable insight how it is organized in the present and its possibilities for the future.

Digital tools will facilitate these explorations. Students will work with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), one of the most exciting (and marketable) new technologies to map the Islamic world. Digital multilingual tools will facilitate students' encounter with the original texts, whether or not students have had prior exposure to Modern Standard Arabic. Students of Arabic will have an opportunity to work with Classical Arabic sources using state-of-the-art multilingual services to leverage their current knowledge. Students with no knowledge of Arabic will use existing English translations that can be used in combination with the original text. All students will have an opportunity to contribute to a major new project that will reinvent how we visualize and understand the Islamic World. By the end of the course we will produce an interactive map of the classical Islamic world, with its major provinces, towns, villages and routes that connected them. Valuable in and of itself, it will become a crucial tool for the study of other primary sources on Islamic history.

\newthought{Concentrating on digital humanities},\marginnote{\textsc{Learning objectives}} this course aims at achieving two major goals. One, more traditional, is to introduce students to the medieval Arabic geography in general, and a specific geographical treatise in particular. We are to learn what the Islamic world was in geographical terms, what were its major provinces and how these provinces were interconnected. The second goal, less traditional, is to introduce students to some digital approaches and tools that facilitate working with historical and geographical information. One of the most important things to learn is how to work with data.

\section{Digital projects}

\textbf{NB:} Detailed descriptions of and instructions for each project will be provided in the Appendix to the Syllabus.

\newthought{Project I}\marginnote{\textsc{Reviews of studies that rely on historical GIS}}
is a review that must summarize major contributions of 10 article (half a page per article). Tufts library catalog offers a rather significant number of titles that can be reviewed; a great number of articles can also be found in such repositories as JSTOR, Project MUSE, and ProQuest. Summarizing the articles, try answering succinctly the following questions: 1) What GIS technologies have been used? 2) What historical questions they allow to answer? 3) Has this been done convincingly? 4) How else can these approaches be used with regard to the topic of the course?

% consider http://www.e-perimetron.org/

\newthought{Project II}\marginnote{\textsc{Annotating data from the source}} will involve short annotations for major entities that feature our source. The goal is to identify them succinctly, but using reliable sources (for example, \textit{Encyclopaedia of Islam}), citing them appropriately. Later on, these annotations are to be used for final projects, thematic maps. Every student must submit these identification online into a shared document at least 2 hours before the beginning of the class. ``Entities'' may include anything mentioned in the text: terms, individuals, places etc. (5 entities for each class). Detailed annotation scheme and instructions will be provided.

\newthought{Project III}\marginnote{\textsc{Arabic Language Project}} is a language exercise.
Depending on whether you studied Arabic before or not, you will get one of the following two assignments that involve working with the original Arabic text. \textit{If you have never studied Arabic before}, you will be given short sections of Arabic text (5-10 short definitions of place names from our main source, all sharing the same structure). Your goal will be to figure (a) how the name of the place is pronounced, and (b) what kind of place that is. You will be encouraged to use any means to solve this (electronic dictionaries, translators, friends who know Arabic, etc.). Detailed instructions will be provided. \textit{If you studied Arabic before}, your task will be to provide Arabic equivalents and their proper transliteration to the annotated data that everybody will be working on. We can discuss more challenging options.

\newthought{Project IV}\marginnote{\textsc{Georeferencing \and Visualization: Building Digital Maps}} is a complex task that involves working with multiple sources that come in different formats and different digital tools that help us create necessary data sets and visualize them. The main goal of this section is to get acquainted with the basic concepts of data formats (tabulated format/CSV, XML/KML), data  manipulation (conversion from one format to another with Python scripts), and data visualization (using Google Earth).

\newthought{Project V}\marginnote{\textsc{Final Project: Thematic Maps}} is aimed at combining information produced within previous projects in order to create thematic maps for the Islamic world of our period. Thematic maps may include one of the following: (a) religious groups; legal schools; Qur"'"anic recitations; (b) local dynasties; (c) economies: production, exports, measures, weights, coinage, taxes; (d) languages; (e) sacred geography: mosques and holy places; (f) sights and marvels; (e) customs and curiosities.



\section{Course Workflow Overview}
The course\marginnote{\textsc{Part I}} is made of three major parts. During the first part of the course we will discuss the essentials, namely the importance of geography for understanding history, and hence the present. We will also discuss major topics of al-Muqaddas"i's geographical treatise and what we can learn from this source using geographical information systems. \textsc{Digital Project I} (\textit{GIS Articles Review}) will be due by the end of the first part.

During the second part\marginnote{\textsc{Part II}} of the course we will be reading al-Muqaddas"i's descriptions of each major province and extracting all the information that can be visualized on geographical maps; first and foremost, this means identifying major geographical entities (districts, metropolises, towns, large villages, and key way stations); finding their locations using available means; and adding this information into our database; with major entities identified, we will connect them via the network of main roads and trade routes that al-Muqaddas"i also provides. \textsc{Digital Projects} II, III and IV will be due by the end of the second part (\textit{Annotation}, \textit{Arabic Language Project}, \textit{Georeferencing \and Visualization}, respectively).

During the third part\marginnote{\textsc{Part III}} of the course we will concentrate on completing your final projects. We will re-read al-Muqaddas"i's treatise from specific thematic perspectives that your selected for your final projects and discuss them in class. \textsc{The final digital project} (\textit{Thematic Maps}) will be due by the end of this part and the last session of our class will be reserved for your presentations of your final research (\textbf{NB}: Your annotated maps will be available on the website of our project afterwards).

\newpage
\section{Policies}

\newthought{The best way to contact me}\marginnote{\textsc{Contacting Instructor}} is via \href{maxim.romanov@tufts.edu}{e-mail}. I check my email regularly and I will try to respond to your questions within 24 hours. The turnover time, however, will be longer on weekends. E-mail, however, is not instantaneous and you might be able to find the answer to your question on the syllabus or by talking with your classmates. They are a great resource! Please, include ``Mapping the Classical Islamic World,'' or ``MCIW'' in the subject line of your e-mail; this will also help me to recognize it and ensure that it does not end up in the junk mail folder.

\newthought{Class attendance is required}.\marginnote{\textsc{Attendance policy}} Absences for religious holidays, family emergencies, and properly documented medical reasons will be excused. Missed quizzes and exams can be completed upon presentation of proper documentation. 

\newthought{All assignments must be submitted on time}\marginnote{\textsc{Assignments}}, unless previously discussed. The grade for a late assignment will be decreased 1/5 of the total grade per day. All assignments must be submitted before the end of the semester.

\newthought{Students can make up work}\marginnote{\textsc{Religious Holidays}} missed for religious holidays if they notify the instructor in advance. Let me know as early as possible in the semester so that we can make arrangements.

\newthought{All necessary accommodations}\marginnote{\textsc{Students with Disabilities}} will be made for students with documented disabilities.

\newthought{Students are required}\marginnote{\textsc{Cell Phone Policy}} to turn their cell phones and other electronic devices off when in class.


\newthought{Students should be aware}\marginnote{\textsc{Statement on Academic Ethics}: If necessary, consult Tufts University's resources on \href{http://uss.tufts.edu/arc/writingresources/plagiarism.asp}{plagiarism} and \href{http://uss.tufts.edu/studentAffairs/documents/HandbookAcademicIntegrity.pdf}{academic integrity}.} of the University's policies on academic integrity. Plagiarism, submission of work that is not one's own or for which previous credit has been obtained, any other form of cheating during tests and/or examinations, and personation at tests and/or examinations are all examples of academic dishonesty. Any instances of academic dishonesty will be handled in accordance with university policy.

\section{Appendix I: Descriptions of Digital Projects}
\subsection{Project I: Review of Historical GIS Studies}

### Digital tasks ###

#### A review of 10 articles on historical GIS ####

A review of 10 articles on historical GIS, summarizing their major contributions (half a page per article). Tufts library catalog offers a rather significant number of titles that can be reviewed; a great number of articles can also be found in such repositories as JSTOR, Project MUSE, and ProQuest. Summarizing the articles, try answering succinctly the following questions: 1) What GIS technologies have been used? 2) What historical questions they allowed to answer? 3) Has this been done convincingly? 4) How else can these approaches be used with regard to the topic of the course?

__Learning objectives__: hands-on experience of working with (a) online bibliographical databases and electronic libraries; and with (b) using a bibliographic manager.

NB: There several bibliographical managers available, but we will work with _Zotero_, which is a free and open source program with that offers the following major functionality:

+ collecting and managing your bibliography: importing bibliographical records from all major bibliographical repositories and libraries, often PDFs of articles can be automatically downloaded from these repositories (does not work equally well with all repositories); alternatively, PDFs can be downloaded and manually attached to a relevant bibliographical record; records can also be added using DOI (digital object identifier), ISBN/ISSN (international standard book identifier/international standard serial number), or manually typed into Zotero.

+ sharing your bibliographies with your fellow students in order to make sure that you do not review the same items (consider this a training in collaborative work, where, working together, you can cover more ground and advance further).

+ syncing downloaded PDFs with tablets (iPad), where you can read your PDFs without printing them out; different PDF readers allow annotating PDFs; these annotations can be later exported into a separate file (you can use your notes and highlights to write your reviews/summaries).

+ managing your references in your papers and creating/formatting/printing bibliographies.

**This task** should include the following steps:

1. Collect a bibliography of 20 articles that deal with any aspect of historical GIS (historical is understood very broadly; the article does not have to deal with historical questions per se, but you may still demonstrate that described methods and approaches have historical application).

2. Share your bibliography with your fellow students, to make sure that you do not review the same items.

3. Write your summaries/reviews directly in Zotero; your final paper should start with an introductory paragraph that quickly overviews major topics and results of the articles under review (do not forget to cite each article, using capabilities of Zotero---it is very quick and very easy); the introductory paragraph is to be followed by a bibliography of the ten pieces that you selected and reviewed; **NB:** write summaries/reviews directly in Zotero (a link to tutorial), and export Bibliography into your Word file; if you select an appropriate style, your annotations will be automatically included into your Bibliography after each reviewed title.

#### Annotating data from the source (ongoing) ####

Initially, this will involve only short annotations to every unknown entity that we come across in our main source. The goal is to identify each one of them succinctly, but using reliable sources (Encyclopaedia of Islam, for example). Later on, these annotations are to be infused into maps that we are going to build. Detailed annotation scheme and instructions will be provided.

#### Arabic Language Project ####

Depending on whether you studied Arabic before or not, you will get one of the following two assignments that involve working with the original Arabic text.

1. _If you have never studied Arabic before_, you will be given short sections of Arabic text (5-10 short definitions of place names from our main source, all sharing the same structure). Your goal will be to figure (a) how the name of the place is pronounced, and (b) what kind of place that is. You will be encouraged to use any means to solve this (electronic dictionaries, translators, friends who know Arabic, etc.). Detailed instructions will be provided.

2. _If you studied Arabic before_, your task will be to provide Arabic equivalents and their proper transliteration to the annotated data that everybody will be working on. We can discuss more challenging options.

#### Building Digital Maps ####

This is a complex task that involves working with multiple sources that come in different formats and different digital tools that help us create necessary data sets and visualize them. The main goal of this section is to get acquainted with the basic concepts of data formats (tabulated format, CSV, KML), data  manipulation (conversion from one format to another with Python scripts), and data visualization (using Google Earth). This task will involve:

1. Geo-referencing of existing historical paper maps (Cornu's Atlas: places, routes and canals), using ArcGIS.

2. Converting created data set into KML format for visualization with Google Earth (can be displayed online), using Python scripts for re-formatting data (scripts will be provided).

3.

#### Final Project: Thematic Maps ####
