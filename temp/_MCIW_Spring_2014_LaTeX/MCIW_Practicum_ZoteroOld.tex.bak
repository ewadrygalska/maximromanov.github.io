\subsection*{\includegraphics[scale=.5]{zotero_icon} \textsc{Zotero}: Bibliography Manager}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Download and install \textsc{Zotero Standalone} from \href{https://www.zotero.org/}{www.zotero.org}.
  
  \item Install an extension for your browser, by choosing one of the following options : \includegraphics[scale=.4]{zotero_connectors}~.  
  \item Add a book reference from Amazon and/or the Tufts Library Catalog
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item find al-Muqaddas"i's ``Best Divisions;'' open the page of the book and click on \includegraphics[scale=.85]{zotero_addbook}, a blue book icon in the right corner of the address pane of your browser; the reference will be added and you will see the following pop-up in the right lower corner of your screen:\\\includegraphics[scale=.5]{zotero_bookadded}
  
  \item download a PDF from Trunk and attach it to the record. (Drag-n-drop the PDF file on the reference in Zotero.) 
  \end{itemize}  
  
  \item Use \includegraphics[scale=.5]{zotero_isbndoi} to add a book reference using ISBN\footnote{\textbf{ISBN}: International Serial Book Number.}. Try one of the following numbers:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 9781405191463, 9780226808772, 9781848854512, 9780199913879
  \end{itemize}  
  
  \item Use \includegraphics[scale=.5]{zotero_isbndoi} also to add an article reference using DOI.\footnote{\textbf{DOI}: Digital Object Identifier.} Try the following number:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 10.3200/HMTS.41.1.39-64
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item Add an article from JSTOR (go to JSTOR through the Tufts Library Catalog):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item find some article on GIS or Arab geography.
  \item import it into Zotero using the same button that you used for importing book reference before, although the button now looks like a sheet of paper \includegraphics[scale=.85]{zotero_addarticle}~.
  \item see what happens...
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{\includegraphics[scale=.85]{google_earth_icon} \textsc{Google Earth}: A Simple Mapping Solution}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Download and install \textsc{Google Earth} from \href{http://www.google.com/earth/}{www.google.com/earth/}~.
  
  \item Open \textsc{Google Earth} and try to create major objects, using the panel with icons \includegraphics[scale=0.50]{google_earth_buttons}.
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \includegraphics[scale=0.50]{google_earth_b1} Placemark adds a single point (village, town, city, etc.);
  \item \includegraphics[scale=0.50]{google_earth_b2} Polygon adds an area (lake, country, province, etc.);
  \item \includegraphics[scale=0.50]{google_earth_b3} Path creates a line (river, road, borderline, etc.);
  \item \includegraphics[scale=0.50]{google_earth_b4} Image Overlay allows one to ``fit'' any image on top of the Earth surface (e.g., you want to try how an image of a historical map fits onto the modern 3D globe);
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item Icons or KML? Using the icons to add geographical information is convenient for some tasks, but may be quite cumbersome for some other. In the latter cases working directly with the KML-format\footnote{KML is a version of XML, a flexible format where specific bits of information are wrapped in corresponding tags. Most KML/XML files can be opened and edited in any text editor.} may be a better option. KML allows you to get a better control over some parameters: for example, you can type in the exact coordinates, instead of trying to find them with your mouse. Each KML-record looks like the code that you see below.\footnote{Keep in mind that this is not a complete KML/XML format, but it is sufficient for drag-n-dropping into the Google Earth environment. This is a simplified version that should help you to understand the basic principles of how XML works.}
 
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
<Placemark>
  <name>Plains of Sinjar</name>
  <Point>
    <coordinates>42.5,35.5,0</coordinates>
  </Point>
</Placemark>
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Note that there are opening (for example, \texttt{$<$Placemark$>$}) and closing (for example, \texttt{$<$/Placemark$>$}) tags for each piece of information. This is how Google Earth knows how to parse this text and convert text information into proper instructions for mapping. Placemark, polygon and path differ only in the way of how their coordinates are provided: they have different number of coordinate points and different wrapping tags that tell Google Earth what kind of geometry is represented.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Placemark has only one set of coordinates, which are wrapped into the \texttt{$<$Point$>$} tags;
  \item Path may also have any number of coordinates as necessary to reflect the desired shape of a path; they are wrapped into the \texttt{$<$LineString$>$} tags;
  \item Polygon may have any number of coordinates necessary to reflect the desired shape of an area; since polygons has a more complex geometry than placemarks and paths, they are wrapped into a series of tags, such as \texttt{$<$outerBoundaryIs$>$}, \texttt{$<$LinearRing$>$}, etc.
  \end{itemize}
  
\item \textbf{Important note on coordinates.} Keep in mind that coordinates in the KML-format have three values (\texttt{longitude, latitude, altitude}) and they are given in \textit{decimal} values, \textbf{not} degrees, minutes and seconds; \textbf{N}orth and \textbf{E}ast are positive, while \textbf{S}outh and \textbf{W}est are negative. This means that you may need to convert degrees, minutes and seconds into decimal values, which can be done quickly with online converters (for example, @ \href{http://transition.fcc.gov/mb/audio/bickel/DDDMMSS-decimal.html}{fcc.gov}, or \href{http://www.satsig.net/degrees-minutes-seconds-calculator.htm}{www.satsig.net}).

  \item Experiment with the sample KML-files.
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Download sample KML-files from Trunk:\footnote{\texttt{Resources $>$ Practicum Files $>$ Google Earth}} \texttt{Sample Placemark.kml}, \texttt{Sample Path.kml}, \texttt{Sample Polygon.kml}.
  
  \item Drag-n-drop each one of them into Google Earth. Since these are simplified KML records, there is no information on formatting (for example, neither icons nor colors are specified). These parameters can be modified in Google Earth by changing the \texttt{properties} of individual records or a group of records simultaneously.
  
  \item Open each of these sample files in a text editor and try to change parameters (only within the \texttt{<Name>} and \texttt{<coordinates>} tags). Save your changes as separate files. Drag-n-drop into Google Earth and see what changed.
  
  \item You can save all your changes as KML files\footnote{Google Earth may offer you to save the file as KMZ, which is a zipped version of KML. This format cannot be changed in a text editor. If you open a saved KML, you will see that there is much more data in there, since this Google Earth saves \textit{complete} KML files, not just single records with which you started.} as well and load them back into Google Earth at any other time; you can also backup your files and share them with your classmates.
