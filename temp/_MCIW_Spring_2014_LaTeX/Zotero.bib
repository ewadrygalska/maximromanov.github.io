	abstract = {Publisher's description: A magisterial work of social history, Life After Death illuminates the many different ways ancient civilizations grappled with the question of what exactly happens to us after we die. In a masterful exploration of how Western civilizations have defined the afterlife, Alan F. Segal weaves together biblical and literary scholarship, sociology, history, and philosophy. A renowned scholar, Segal examines the maps of the afterlife found in Western religious texts and reveals not only what various cultures believed but how their notions reflected their societies' realities and ideals, and why those beliefs changed over time. He maintains that the afterlife is the mirror in which a society arranges its concept of the self. The composition process for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam begins in grief and ends in the victory of the self over death. Arguing that in every religious tradition the afterlife represents the ultimate reward for the good, Segal combines historical
and anthropological data with insights gleaned from religious and philosophical writings to explain the following mysteries: why the Egyptians insisted on an afterlife in heaven, while the body was embalmed in a tomb on earth; why the Babylonians viewed the dead as living in underground prisons; why the Hebrews remained silent about life after death during the period of the First Temple, yet embraced it in the Second Temple period (534 {B.C.E.-70} {C.E.);} and why Christianity placed the afterlife in the center of its belief system. He discusses the inner dialogues and arguments within Judaism and Christianity, showing the underlying dynamic behind them, as well as the ideas that mark the differences between the two religions. In a thoughtful examination of the influence of biblical views of heaven and martyrdom on Islamic beliefs, he offers a fascinating perspective on the current troubling rise of Islamic fundamentalism. In tracing the organic, historical relationships between sacred
texts and communities of belief and comparing the visions of life after death that have emerged throughout history, Segal sheds a bright, revealing light on the intimate connections between notions of the afterlife, the societies that produced them, and the individual's search for the ultimate meaning of life on earth.},

	abstract = {Summary	

A wide-ranging consideration of the place of dreams and visions in Islamic societies from the premodern period to the present.

Dreams and visions have always been important in Islamic societies. Yet, their pervasive impact on Muslim communities and on the lives of individual Muslims remains largely unknown and rather surprising to Westerners. This book addresses this gap in understanding with a fascinating and diverse account, taking readers from premodern Islam to the present day. Dreams and visions are shown to have been, and to be, significant in a range of social, educational, and cultural roles. The book includes a wealth of examples detailing the Sufi experience. Contributors use Arabic, Persian, Indian, Central Asian, and Ottoman sources and employ approaches grounded in history, sociology, psychology, anthropology, religious studies, and literary analysis. This is an illuminating work, showing how ordinary Muslims, Muslim notables, Sufis, legal scholars, and rulers have perceived both themselves and the world around them through the prism of dreams and visions.

{{\textquotedblleft}This} book provides a marvelous appreciative look at an important aspect of the art of narrative across many facets of Muslim community life, and the endurance of that art through the centuries. The stories communicate not only substantial elements of theological importance but a pervasive sense of the significance of personal relationships, especially affection for the Prophet, all told with much warmth and wit.{\textquotedblright} {\textemdash} John Renard, author of Islam and Christianity: Theological Themes in Comparative Perspective

	shorttitle = {Constructing the past in eleventh-century Flanders},
	abstract = {At the heart of much scholarship on the Central Middle Ages (c. 950--1150) in western Europe is a debate about the rapidity and nature of change after the disintegration of the Carolingian empire. On the one hand, there is the traditional "mutationist" position, represented by such scholars as Marc Bloch, Jean-Pierre Poly, Eric Bournazel, Georges Duby, and T. N. Bisson. Scholars who adopt this position argue that a revolution, a radical and sharp break with the past, occurred in the structure of western European society around the turn of the millenium. On the other hand, a diverse group, including Dominique Barthelemy, Susan Reynolds, Timothy Reuter and Chris Wickham, has either argued for less rapid change or questioned key aspects of the traditional position.
In Phantoms of Remembrance, Patrick Geary has suggested that the debate over the mutationist interpretation has ceased to bear positive fruit, and that the important question in studying the Central Middle Ages is "why and how generations perceived discontinuity, and how these perceptions continued to influence the patterns of thought for a thousand years." According to Geary, although people in the eleventh century were surrounded with the residue of the previous two centuries, they were unable to make sense of the structures that had given this residue its coherence. Nevertheless, people in the period still attempted to make sense of the past, shaping it to fit contemporary needs. This process is important because it determined both the information people chose to make available to future generations and the form it would take. Put simply, how they chose to remember their past influences how we remember it.
My dissertation examines how the hagiography produced for the eleventh-century, Flemish abbey of Saint-Winnoc remembers the past. More specifically, it approaches these texts from three perspectives. First, it identifies the literary strategies their authors employed to construct the past. Second, it examines how these strategies would have operated in the historical context in which they were composed. Finally, it points to some of the ontological, epistemological and ideological implications of recording the past in hagiographic narratives.},

	shorttitle = {Catch and Release},
	abstract = {This dissertation examines the legal and administrative impact of piracy and amphibious slave-raiding in the eastern half of the Mediterranean basin in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Rising maritime violence in the Mediterranean after the 1570s had a tremendous effect on the formation of international law, the conduct of diplomacy, the articulation of Ottoman imperial and Islamic law, and their application in local Ottoman courts. Utilizing a wide range of Ottoman, Venetian, and English archival and manuscript sources, the story told is about piracy, but it is not about pirates. Instead, this dissertation explores the murky legal waters in which piracy and amphibious slave-raiding flourished and the broad array of actors who were involved in and affected by Ottoman efforts to create order in the chaos. 
To date, little of the scholarship on Mediterranean maritime violence has made use of Ottoman source material. Thus, the principal power in the Eastern Mediterranean has been almost entirely left out of the story, which has been cast instead as a two-sided holy war at sea, with the corsairs of North Africa lined up against those of Malta and Livorno. This dissertation returns the Ottoman state to the story of the late sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Mediterranean, shifting the reader{\textquoteright}s gaze away from the pirates and onto the administrators, jurists, and victims{\textemdash}those who had to contend most with the consequences of rising maritime violence. In so doing, it argues that what made the eastern half of the Mediterranean the {{\textquotedblleft}Ottoman} Mediterranean,{\textquotedblright} more so than naval supremacy or political control, was that it was a unified legal space. It was the challenge of piracy that helped to define its contours.},
