The auto-correct function in MS Word can make life easier when transliterating Arabic. I have been using a template file with main symbols assigned to simple combinations for quite a while and some of my fellow graduate students found this method very convenient. It is quite simple: create a new file with the attached template (see below)&#8230; type commas before and after the letter which is to be transliterated (for capital letters type letters twice). Some major terms are also added to this auto-correct template, e.g. Quran > Qurʾān, hadith > </span><em style="line-height: 1.7;">ḥadīth</em><span style="line-height: 1.7;">, madhhab > </span><em style="line-height: 1.7;">madhhab</em><span style="line-height: 1.7;">, etc. The list can always be expanded if necessary.



``` 
ʿ = ,`,     Ā = ,aa,    Ḍ = ,dd,    Ṭ = ,tt,
Ū = ,uu,    ʾ = ,/,     ā = ,a,     ḍ = ,d,
ṭ = ,t,     ū = ,u,     Ī = ,ii,    Ṣ = ,ss,
Ḥ = ,hh,    Ẓ = ,zz,    ī = ,i,     ṣ = ,s,
ḥ = ,h,     ẓ = ,z,
```
