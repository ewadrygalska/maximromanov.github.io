This blogpost overviews existing collections of digitized manuscripts of Arabic texts that can be found online. Each collection is described in the same manner in order to provide ground for comparison.

## Ǧāmiʿ al-maḫṭūṭāt al-islāmiyyaŧ [http://wqf.me/](http://wqf.me/)

A collection of thousands of digitized Islamic manuscripts pulled from a number of libraries around the world. The quality of digital surrogates vary from digitized microfiches to high-resolution full color images.

One of the most valuable contributions of this project is *al-Bāḥiṯ fī-l-maḫṭūṭāt al-islāmiyyaŧ*, a downloadable and searchable catalog of almost 116,000 Islamic manuscripts ([link](http://wqf.me/?page_id=16904))
