## Arabic Almanac

Perhaps the most valuable project out there, the Arabic Almanac is a collections of scanned dictionaries that are searcheable by roots. The Almanac uses the *Mawrid Reader*, an extendable HTML/JavaScript app for both desktop and mobile use for displaying and searching books. The Almanac can be downloaded to your hard disk or smart phoneâ€™s SD card, for fast offline usage.

The *Mawrid Reader* makes the *Arabic Almanac* infinitely extendable and over the past few years the number of included dictionaries was significantly increased. As of March 2012, the project includes 31 dictionaries: Arabic-English (10, including such indispensable titles as Hans Wehr, Lane, Steingass, Hava, etc.), Arabic-Urdu (7), Arabic-Arabic (9), Arabic-Indonesian/Malaysian (4), and Arabic-French (Kazimirski).
