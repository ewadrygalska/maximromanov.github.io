#al-Raqmiyyat: Digital Islamic History

The new version of my website, built with Jekyll ~~(and lots of pain and sweat...)~~, using Clean Blog Theme by Start Bootstrap
(The official Jekyll version of the Clean Blog theme by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/), plus a number of elements from other themes (including [Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper), [Notepad](https://github.com/hmfaysal/Notepad), etc.)

## ToDo's

1. embed google analytics
2. add projects folder and move projects there from the old site
3. bio note
4. image handling/styles in posts + figure captions
5. cover images
