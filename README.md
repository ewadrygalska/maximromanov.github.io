#al-Raqmiyyat: Digital Islamic History

The new version of my website, built with Jekyll ~~(and lots of pain and sweat...)~~, using Clean Blog Theme by Start Bootstrap
(The official Jekyll version of the Clean Blog theme by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/), plus a number of elements from other themes (including [Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper), [Notepad](https://github.com/hmfaysal/Notepad), etc.)

## ToDo's

1. embed google analytics
2. add projects folder and move projects there from the old site
3. bio note
4. image handling/styles in posts + figure captions
5. cover images
6. add favicon
7. form CV in some stylish way :)

1. ```git reset -- hard```
	* (rolls back to previous commit; provide commit id to roll back to specific commit)
1. ```git add --all```
	* adds all new files and changed files to what is to be committed
1. ```git commit -m "text"```
	* commits changes: "text" is the comment that logs what exactly was changed
1. ```git push -u origin master```
	* pushes committed changes to the gitHub repository
